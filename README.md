Exactly! Who am I? Do we live in a simulation? Hahaha, just kidding.

### Ideology:

Write clean codes. Period. A clean code always looks like it was written by sb who cares. As developers, we have to make sure that it's readable so that others could maintain our modules. So here are my 3 clean code postulates:
	1. Clean code is simple and direct, and it reads like well-written prose.
	2. The only way to go fast is to go slow.
	3. Clean code does one thing well.

### Future Goals:

I aspire to create an app in Unreal Engine 5. I was absolutely memorized and bewitched by the Beta! I have been practicing in creating 3D models in UE4 as well as in Blender for a year and considering creating a game in Cyberpunk style. It requires advanced skills in C++, so that is what I pour my heart and soul into. As Albert Einstein once said: ‚ÄúImagination is more important than knowledge‚Äù, I do my best in making creative and recognizable projects (Fun Fact: I'm a Graphic Designer too).

### Aspiration:
---

Genius lies in simplicity ‚Äî I thirst for making an impact on Game Development. Being a huge fan of game experience myself I would love to make something astonishing and highly memorable. I can talk for hours about the technologies behind GTA V, Cyberpunk, FarCry and Red Dead Redemption II. Constant learning in International Winter School on Software Engineering, JetBrains Academy, Tincoff Fintex and many other schools broaden my IT horizons even more.
